# wide-slick-slider-elementor
A wide slick slider for Elementor : images are used as background-image, since that allows to use `background-size: cover` and keep the image really full-width, with no distortion.

Only caveat: Images are not seen as <img /> or <figure /> and won't be referenced by searchbots... 

If you miss a Slick slider feature, don't hesitate to raise an issue or - even better - make a pull request...
